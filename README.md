and fast iterative methods. It prints the calculated Fibonacci numbers and the time
taken for each calculation.

The main method calculates and prints Fibonacci numbers using both recursive and fast iterative methods for a range of values.


Calculates the Fibonacci number recursively.
Calculates the Fibonacci number using a fast iterative method.

Changes made:Improved Functionality:
Moved the Fibonacci functions (fibRecursive and fibFast) inside a nested Slow class to better organize the code.
