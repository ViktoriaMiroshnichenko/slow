The Slow class demonstrates the calculation of Fibonacci numbers using both recursive
and fast iterative methods. It prints the calculated Fibonacci numbers and the time
taken for each calculation.

The main method calculates and prints Fibonacci numbers using both recursive and fast iterative methods for a range of values.

Calculates the Fibonacci number recursively.
